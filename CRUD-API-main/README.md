# ðŸ§© Django CRUD API with Django REST Framework

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** API built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework**. It uses **function-based views** and demonstrates how to serialize, deserialize, and handle HTTP methods properly in a RESTful way.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

-  Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
-  Function-Based Views using `@api_view`
-  Serialization & Deserialization of data
-  Proper HTTP status handling (200, 201, 400, 404)
-  Tested thoroughly using Postman
